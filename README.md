## Fuel-Savings-Project
This contains the original data I recorded consisting of the fuel levels of 100 inbound vehicles along with their make/model and fuel tank capacity. Along with the data is a PDF visualizing the data as a histogram along with an analysis of how this data can be applied to save cost on fuel purchases.
